## My playground for learning NEAT-like algorithms !

Inspired from https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python but the
algorithm is not the same. It still relies on the same approach of
random mutation and contest based selection.

A good start to understand how it works is to look at `bin/sandbox.php`.

This is not meant to be used in real life cases as performances of object
oriented approach performs well under array approaches. Objects makes it
easy to understand the concepts.
